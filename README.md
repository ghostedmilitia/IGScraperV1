# IGScraperV1
With this tool you are able to gather Json parsed data from an Instagram account. The data will contain: ID, FBID, DeviceIDs, Account Information, Rollout Hash keys, ALL OF IT. Please do enjoy!! If you have any issues with my tool, feel free to message me on Instagram : @ghostedmilitia !!

# Note
When you clone this project onto your own computer environment and you import it through Visual Studio via Git Clone, you want to let it all completely load until you get the go ahead/ready sign or signal, and then you want to 'build solution', I believe.

# Sorry-
Yeah, I apologize if some of this text that I'm typing doesn't make sense, doing the best i can at explaining the whole process.

# Usage
When in command-line, you want to type in: ``IGScraperV1.exe <username>``; Where "<username>" is, you would want to replace that with any username that you would like. It's quite simple. :)
